Welcome to Grasswire, Your Newsrooom.
------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Grasswire, the news service that anyone can edit.

Grasswire functions just like any other newsroom, but with two important differences: everything happens online, and you can be part of it.

A great way to start is in the Grasswire Slack channel. There we research the news, discuss our findings, and fact-check everything. 

At the end of each day, the Grasswire Digest -- a short compilation of that day's work -- is sent by e-mail to tens of thousands of people. A short-form mobile app is coming soon.

Jump in the Grasswire newsroom to get started, and feel free to drop us a line at any time.
